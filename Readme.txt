The JpCap library used for this project is only available in 32 bit version. Therefore, if your computer is 64 bit, copy the 
file 'jpcap.jar' into 
C:\Program Files\Java\Your JRE Version\lib\ext
C:\Program Files\Java\Your JDK Version\jre\lib\ext

And also

JpCap.dll into C:\Program Files\Java\Your JRE Version\bin 
C:\Program Files\Java\Your JDK Version\jre\bin


For 32 bit users, simply install the JpCap setup and the WinPCap set up. 

Make sure the set up is run only after you have instlalled your JRE on your computer. this is because the JPcap set up is meant to install into 
specific JRE folders which must be avaiable at installation time.

JPcap, WinPCap setup, JPCap.dll and JPCap.jar can be found in the 'Other Needed Files' folder
